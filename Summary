What I learned was mainly that every simulation is different. This is because of the random code 
lines in the code. I also learned that efficency has a much better mark on time then increasing 
the number of checkout lanes open. In real life it would be difficult to plan for how many checkout
you need because of surges and dead times. Nothing is concrete on how many people will arrive when.
